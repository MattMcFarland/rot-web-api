### Dungeon generator server

Generate dungeon maps from a server REST API!

More documentation coming.

### Server setup

Clone this repo, then run npm install/npm start, which will then output the url to your localhost:8080.

### Browser Example

When server is running, you can navigate to the root url and see how index.html interacts with the server.
